/** abstract class that implements all the transitions between states
 *
 * by default all the transitions will throw a WrongStateTransitionException and
 * this behaviour will be common between all states, the actual
 * transitions are meant to be defined at the state classes itself
 *
 * for instance, the transitions that are defined are:
 * -resetController
 * -newChapter
 * -chapterEnds
 * -playerKO
 * -diceMiss
 * -diceHit
