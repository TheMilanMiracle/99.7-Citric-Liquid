/** class that represents the turn loop state
 *
 * when having this state, the controller will check which player
 * is playing (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th)
 * it will make the controller transition to the NewChapterState if the 4th
 * player just ended its turn
 * otherwise it will make the controller transition to the Recovery or
 * StarsAndDice state depending on the current player HP
 *
 * this class overrides the next transitions:
 * -chapterEnds (TurnLoopState -> NewChapterState)
 * -recovery (TurnLoopState -> RecoveryState)
