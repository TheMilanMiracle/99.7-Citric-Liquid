/** class that represents the recovery game state
 *
 * this state is reached when the current player playing
 * is KO, meaning, its HP are 0 and to get out of recovery
 * the player has to roll a dice
 * if the dice meets the needed roll the controller transitions
 * to the StarsAndDiceState
 * if the dice doesnt meets the needed roll the controller goes back to
 * the TurnLoopState with the next player
 *
 * this class overrides the next transitions:
 * - diceMiss (RecoveryState -> TurnLoopState)
 * - diceHit (RecoveryState -> StarsAndDiceState)
