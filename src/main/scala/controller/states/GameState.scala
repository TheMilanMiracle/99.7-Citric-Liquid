/** Interface that represent a game state
 *
 * The game has multiple states and the controller will act
 * differently on each one
 *
 *
 * this interface shows all the transitions that a state 'can' do
 * which means that it not necessarily will correctly transition
 * states
 *
 * for instance, an game state can:
 * - call resetController (StartingState -> NewChapterState)
 * - call newChapter (NewChapterState -> TurnLoopState)
 * - call chapterEnds (TurnLoopState -> NewChapterState)
 * - call playerKO (TurnLoopState -> RecoveryState)
 * - call diceMiss (RecoveryState -> TurnLoopState)
 * - call diceHit (RecoveryState -> StarsAndDiceState)
 * - call playerNotKO (TurnLoopState -> StarsAndDiceState)
