/** An abstract class that implements common behaviour between Game Units

 * - a game unit can get their basics stats HP, attack, defense, evasion and its name
 * - a game unit can get and set their current HP, maintaining the value between 0 and maxHP
 * - a game unit can get and set their current number of stars
