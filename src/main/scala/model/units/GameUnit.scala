/** The GameUnit interface represent the entity that will participate

 * basic attributes as HP, attack, defense and evasion. Game units can hold
 * a quantity of stars that may vary throughout a game
 *
 * For instance, game units can:
 *
 * - get their basics stats HP, attack, defense, evasion and its name
 * - get and set their current HP, maintaining the value between 0 and maxHP
 * - get and set their current number of stars
