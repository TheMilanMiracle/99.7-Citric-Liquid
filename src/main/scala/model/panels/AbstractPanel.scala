/** An abstract class that implements common behaviour between Panels
 *
 *  even tho each kind of panel has its own effect, there are some actions/values
 *  that every panel has to be able to do/have independent of its type and the
 *  implementation/value is the same
 *
 *  the common behaviour that this abstract class implements is:
 *  - A panel can get its position, a copy of its players and a copy of its panels
 *  - A panel can hold one or more players
 *  - A panel can add or remove a player from itself
 *  - A panel can add and remove a panel from its next panels
