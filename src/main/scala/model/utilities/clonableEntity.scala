/** Interface that represent any kind of game entity that should

 * The usefulness of this interface is evident when we define getters of an instance of an
 * object with attributes, because if we don't return a copy, we return the whole object. Meaning that its attributes
 * would be directly changeable, making the fact of them being private meaningless
